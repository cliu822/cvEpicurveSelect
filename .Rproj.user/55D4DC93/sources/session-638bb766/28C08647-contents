\title{Evaluate candidate municipalities using a single cross-validation scheme}
\usage{
eval_candidates(
  goal_vec,
  candidate_mat,
  block_labels,
  previously_selected = numeric(0)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{goal_vec}{Vector of case counts for the goal municipality (length = number of time points)}

\item{candidate_mat}{Matrix of case counts from all candidate municipalities (n_time_points x n_candidates)}

\item{block_labels}{A character vector of block labels (e.g., "A", "B", "C"), same length as goal_vec}

\item{previously_selected}{Indices of previously selected municipalities (columns in candidate_mat) to include}
}
\value{
A list with:
  - R2: Vector of R² values for each (block × candidate)
  - selected: Vector of candidate names corresponding to each R²
  - oos_est: Matrix of out-of-sample predictions (same shape as candidate_mat)
}
\description{
For each candidate municipality, this function fits a linear model to predict the goal municipality
using cross-validation defined by a single CV block labeling. Returns the out-of-sample R² and predictions.
