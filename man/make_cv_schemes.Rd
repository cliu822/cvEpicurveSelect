\title{Generate Cross-Validation Schemes}
\usage{
make_cv_schemes(tot_ts, n_cv_schemes, block_length = 3, freq = 52)
}
\arguments{
\item{tot_ts}{Total number of time points (e.g., total weeks of data)}

\item{n_cv_schemes}{Number of replicate cross-validation block labelings schemes to generate}

\item{block_length}{Number of years per block (default: 3). Each block is used as a test set once.}

\item{freq}{Number of time points per year (e.g., 52 for weekly data)}
}
\value{
A list of length \code{n_cv_schemes}. Each element is a character vector of length \code{tot_ts},
assigning each time point to a block label (e.g., "A", "B", "C").
}
\description{
This function generates multiple randomized cross-validation labeling schemes for a time series of outcomes, where each scheme divides the timeline into repeating blocks (e.g., "A", "B", "C") used for testing and training in assessing candidates.
