\title{Evaluate candidates via out-of-sample corr² from multilinear regression}
\usage{
eval_candidates(
  goal_vec,
  candidate_mat,
  block_labels,
  previously_selected = numeric(0)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{goal_vec}{Vector of time-stratified (e.g., weekly) cases in the target area}

\item{candidate_mat}{Matrix of candidate cases (time units × candidate areas)}

\item{block_labels}{Character vector of block labelings for a single cross-validation scheme}

\item{previously_selected}{Integer vector of indices of previously selected areas}
}
\value{
A list with:
\itemize{
  \item \code{corr²}: Vector of corr² values for each (block × candidate)
  \item \code{selected}: Vector of candidate names corresponding to each corr²
  \item \code{oos_est}: Matrix of out-of-sample predictions (same shape as \code{candidate_mat})
}
}
\description{
This function evaluates each candidate area by fitting a linear regression model to predict case counts in a target area using cross-validation. For each cross-validation scheme, it calculates the out-of-sample corr² for each candidate (in combination with any previously selected candidates) and stores the predicted values across all time points.
